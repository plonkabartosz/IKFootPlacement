# IKFootPlacement

IKFootPlacement is a free C# script for Unity engine that controls the position and rotation of character’s feet, relative to the ground beneath. The script supports characters with any number of legs, which means it does not require the usage of a humanoid avatar. Instead it works with the use of Two Bone IK Constraint provided with the the Animation Rigging package from Unity.
